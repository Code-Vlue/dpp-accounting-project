# DPP Accounting Platform Deployment Summary

## Current Deployment Status

The DPP Accounting Platform has been deployed in two configurations:

### 1. Static Deployment (S3/CloudFront)
- **Status**: Deployed and accessible
- **CloudFront URL**: https://d3b2beatmnvsp8.cloudfront.net
- **S3 Bucket**: dpp-accounting-platform-prod
- **Limitations**: Static rendering only, no server-side functionality

### 2. Server-Side Rendering Deployment (AWS Amplify)
- **Status**: Configured but deployment not completed
- **App ID**: d2imcl999tngnc
- **App Name**: DPP-Accounting-Platform
- **Default Domain**: d2imcl999tngnc.amplifyapp.com
- **Advantages**: Full server-side rendering support for dynamic functionality

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: AWS Amplify Console (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach for deploying a full Next.js application with server-side rendering support:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service
3. Find the existing app "DPP-Accounting-Platform" (ID: d2imcl999tngnc)
4. Connect to your GitHub repository (or use manual deployment)
5. Configure build settings (already set up)
6. Deploy the application

**Key Files**:
- `amplify.yml`: Defines build configuration
- `next.config.js`: Contains `output: 'standalone'` setting required for SSR

**Detailed Instructions**: See `AMPLIFY-CONSOLE-DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Option 2: Continue with S3/CloudFront (Limited Functionality)

If only static functionality is needed:

1. The application is already deployed at https://d3b2beatmnvsp8.cloudfront.net
2. For updates, build the app with `npm run build && npm run export`
3. Upload the `out` directory to the S3 bucket
4. Create CloudFront invalidation

**Key Files**:
- `deployment-config.js`: Contains deployment configuration
- `scripts/deploy-to-aws.sh`: Deployment script

**Detailed Instructions**: See `docs/deployment-guide.md`

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete the AWS Amplify Deployment**:
   - Follow the instructions in `AMPLIFY-VERIFICATION.md`
   - This will enable full server-side rendering support

2. **Custom Domain Configuration**:
   - Once Amplify deployment is complete, configure a custom domain
   - Instructions are available in `docs/domain-setup.md`

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to AWS Amplify
   - Configure branch-based deployments

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Review and update environment variables in AWS Amplify console
   - Ensure all required variables are properly set

## Deployment Verification

After deployment is complete, verify the application by:

1. **Accessing the Application**:
   - Amplify URL: https://master.d2imcl999tngnc.amplifyapp.com/
   - CloudFront URL: https://d3b2beatmnvsp8.cloudfront.net

2. **Testing Authentication**:
   - Login with test credentials
   - Test signup flow
   - Verify password reset process

3. **Verifying Server-Side Rendering**:
   - Access pages that require data loading
   - Check that data is pre-rendered (view source should show data)
   - Test dynamic routes and parameters

4. **Functional Testing**:
   - Navigate through finance modules
   - Test form submissions and data operations
   - Verify reports generation
