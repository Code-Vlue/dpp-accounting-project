## Technical Architecture

The application is built using the following technology stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.0 with App Router, React 18.2.0, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito
- **Hosting:** AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript 5.3.3

The application follows a modern architecture with:
- Server Components for data-fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Static Site Generation for performance
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture leverages AWS services for scalability, security, and performance:

1. **Static Assets**
   - Hosted in S3 bucket with appropriate caching headers
   - CloudFront distribution for global CDN delivery
   - Invalidation system for updates

2. **Server Components**
   - Next.js standalone server deployment
   - Support for server-side rendering and API routes

3. **Authentication System**
   - AWS Cognito User Pool
   - JWT token handling
   - Secure session management

## Known Issues and Next Steps

While the application is fully deployed, there are some items that require attention:

1. **TypeScript Compliance**
   - Minor TypeScript errors documented in typescript_fixes.md
   - Does not affect runtime functionality
   - Should be addressed in the next iteration

2. **Server Deployment**
   - Static assets are deployed
   - Full server component deployment needed for complete functionality

3. **Domain Configuration**
   - Currently accessible via CloudFront domain
   - Custom domain configuration needed for production use

## Next Steps

1. Complete server component deployment
2. Configure custom domain and SSL certificate
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
5. Address remaining TypeScript issues
6. Conduct user training
7. Implement regular backup procedures
