## Technical Architecture

The application is built using the following technology stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.0 with App Router, React 18.2.0, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito
- **Hosting:** AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript 5.3.3

The application follows a modern architecture with:
- Server Components for data-fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Static Site Generation for performance
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture leverages AWS services for scalability, security, and performance:

1. **Static Assets**
   - Hosted in S3 bucket with appropriate caching headers
   - CloudFront distribution for global CDN delivery
   - Invalidation system for updates

2. **Server Components**
   - Next.js standalone server deployment
   - Support for server-side rendering and API routes

3. **Authentication System**
   - AWS Cognito User Pool
   - JWT token handling
   - Secure session management

## Known Issues and Next Steps

While the application is fully deployed, there are some items that require attention:

1. **TypeScript Compliance**
   - Minor TypeScript errors documented in typescript_fixes.md
   - Does not affect runtime functionality
   - Should be addressed in the next iteration

2. **Server Deployment**
   - Static assets are deployed
   - Full server component deployment needed for complete functionality

3. **Domain Configuration**
   - Currently accessible via CloudFront domain
   - Custom domain configuration needed for production use

## Recommended Deployment Approach

For full server-side rendering support and dynamic functionality, we recommend deploying to AWS Amplify rather than the current static S3/CloudFront deployment. The following deployment options are available:

### Option 1: AWS Amplify Console (Recommended)

For the simplest deployment experience with full SSR support:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Amplify
3. Click "Create app" or "New app"
4. Choose "Host web app"
5. Connect to your GitHub repository
6. Select the master branch
7. Configure build settings:
   - Verify the amplify.yml file is correctly set up
   - Add necessary environment variables
8. Review and deploy
9. After deployment completes, your app will be available at the provided Amplify URL

### Option 2: Manual Amplify Deployment (Advanced)

For more control over the deployment process:

1. Create an Amplify app using the AWS CLI
2. Configure the necessary environment variables
3. Create a deployment package with all required files
4. Create a deployment and upload the package
5. Start the deployment using the AWS CLI

Detailed instructions for both approaches are available in:
- AMPLIFY-CONSOLE-DEPLOYMENT.md
- AMPLIFY-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to AWS Amplify for full server component support
2. Configure custom domain and SSL certificate
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
5. Address remaining TypeScript issues
6. Conduct user training
7. Implement regular backup procedures
