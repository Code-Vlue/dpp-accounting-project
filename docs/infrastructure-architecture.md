# DPP Accounting Platform Infrastructure Architecture

This document outlines the infrastructure architecture for the DPP Accounting Platform, focusing on AWS services used for hosting, content delivery, and domain management.

## Overview

The DPP Accounting Platform uses a serverless architecture on AWS, leveraging multiple services to provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution. The application is built with Next.js and deployed as a static site hosted on S3 and delivered through CloudFront CDN.

## AWS Services

### Route 53 (DNS Management)

- Managed DNS service for domain registration and routing
- Hosts the DNS zone for the domain name
- Provides DNS records for CloudFront and certificate validation
- Enables apex and www domain routing
- Utilized for SSL certificate validation via DNS challenge

### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

- Manages SSL/TLS certificates
- Provides free certificates for use with AWS services
- Supports both apex domain and wildcard subdomains
- Handles certificate renewal automatically
- Integrated with CloudFront for HTTPS termination

### CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)

- Global content delivery network for caching
- Edge locations worldwide for reduced latency
- HTTPS termination and SSL handling
- Default behavior configured for SPA routing
- Error pages for handling 404 and other errors
- Custom headers and security policies
- Cache behaviors for different content types (static, api, etc.)
- Origin access identity for secure S3 access

### S3 (Storage)

- Main bucket: Hosts the Next.js static files
- WWW bucket: Configured to redirect to apex domain
- Logs bucket: Stores access logs for analytics
- Static website hosting for serving content
- Configured with appropriate bucket policies
- Lifecycle rules for log rotation and cost optimization
- Server-side encryption for data protection

## Deployment Strategy

The platform is deployed using a three-environment strategy:

1. **Development**: Automatically deployed on pushes to the main branch
2. **Staging**: Deployed after successful development deployment
3. **Production**: Manually deployed through GitHub workflow

## Deployment Process

1. Next.js application is built with environment-specific variables
2. Static files are exported to a deployment directory
3. Files are synchronized to S3 with appropriate cache controls:
   - Static assets: `max-age=31536000, immutable` (1 year)
   - HTML/JSON: `max-age=3600` (1 hour)
   - Public files: `max-age=86400` (1 day)
4. CloudFront invalidation is created to refresh the cache

## Security Considerations

- **Origin Access Identity**: Restricts S3 access to CloudFront only
- **HTTPS Only**: Configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- **TLS 1.2+**: Uses modern TLS protocols only
- **Access Logging**: Enabled for auditing and monitoring
- **IAM Roles**: Limited permissions for deployment
- **Bucket Policies**: Restricted access to S3 content
- **DNS Security**: DNSSEC for domain name security (if supported by registrar)

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is managed through scripts and GitHub Actions:

- `setup-domain.sh`: Configures Route 53 and ACM
- `setup-cloudfront.sh`: Sets up CloudFront and S3 buckets
- `verify-domain.sh`: Verifies domain configuration
- `verify-cloudfront.sh`: Verifies CloudFront and S3 setup
- `deploy-nextjs.sh`: Deploys the Next.js application

These scripts ensure consistent infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

## Cost Optimization

- S3 Standard storage for optimal cost-performance balance
- CloudFront for reduced data transfer costs
- Object lifecycle management for log files
- Reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Auto-scaling for variable demand

## Monitoring and Logging

- CloudFront access logs stored in S3
- CloudWatch alarms for error rates and performance
- CloudTrail for API activity monitoring
- S3 server access logging for audit purposes

## Disaster Recovery

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: < 1 hour
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: < 15 minutes
- Regular infrastructure state backup
- Cross-region replication for critical data
- Documented recovery procedures

## Compliance and Regulations

- GDPR-compliant infrastructure design
- HIPAA-eligible services used
- Content security policies implemented
- Regular security assessments

## Future Enhancements

- Implement AWS WAF for enhanced security
- Add CloudFront Functions for edge computing
- Implement multi-region failover
- Add Route 53 health checks and DNS failover
