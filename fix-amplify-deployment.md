# Fix for AWS Amplify Deployment

## Issue

The AWS Amplify deployment was failing with the following issues:
1. Middleware causing redirect loops in authentication
2. Static export configuration issues
3. 404 errors when trying to access pages directly

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Disabled the middleware completely**
   - Removed all middleware code that was causing redirect loops

2. **Configured for static export**
   - Updated next.config.js to use `output: 'export'`
   - Removed incompatible options like `rewrites`
   - Set images to `unoptimized: true`

3. **Implemented SPA routing**
   - Added a 404.html page that redirects to the homepage with path info
   - Added client-side routing script to handle the redirects
   - Setup proper routing for AWS Amplify

4. **Fixed build configuration**
   - Updated amplify.yml to use the correct output directory
   - Added necessary file copying steps
   - Set proper headers for caching

5. **Environment variables handling**
   - Added client-side scripts to load environment variables
   - Set up fallback values for testing/dev

## AWS Amplify Console Settings

In the AWS Amplify Console, make sure to:

1. Set the framework preset to "Next.js - SSG"
2. Add the following environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID
   - AWS_REGION

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Add monitoring to catch any issues
3. Consider implementing a proper backend for API routes
