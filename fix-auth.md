# Critical Authentication Fix

This document outlines a critical fix to resolve the infinite redirect loop issue with authentication in the AWS Amplify deployment.

## Root Cause

The primary issue is that the Next.js middleware is causing redirect loops when handling authentication routes, and this is exacerbated by the static deployment in AWS Amplify.

## Implementation

We have implemented a two-pronged approach to fix this issue:

1. **Temporarily disabled middleware entirely**
   - This stops all middleware-based redirects which were causing the loop
   - File changed: `src/middleware.ts`

2. **Created client-side only authentication components**
   - Authentication components now use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`
   - Login page uses a client-only component that doesn't trigger middleware

## Next Steps

After verifying this fix works:

1. Re-enable middleware with proper exclusions for authentication routes
2. Ensure environment variables are correctly passed to client components
3. Verify authentication flow end-to-end

## AWS Amplify Environment Variables

For the authentication to work properly, the following environment variables must be set in the AWS Amplify console:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`: Your Cognito user pool ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`: Your Cognito client ID
- `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region (typically `us-east-1`)

## Testing Instructions

1. Deploy the latest code to AWS Amplify
2. Visit the homepage and navigate to the login page
3. Verify you don't get redirected in an infinite loop
4. Test the authentication flow to ensure it still works

## Long-term Solution

After this immediate fix is confirmed working, we should implement a more robust solution:

1. Properly configure `middleware.ts` with exact, correct exclusions
2. Refactor authentication components to handle static generation better
3. Create proper client-side hydration for authentication state
4. Consider implementing a client-side routing solution that doesn't depend on middleware
